with openspec:

1. Copy ORIG_BEHAVIOR.md to NEW_BEHAVIOUR.md
2. Incorporate my direct proposals that I suggested
3. Review the NEW_BEHAVIOUR.md spec regarding potential gaps and suggest what need to be improved in terms of scenarios and possible new APIs
4. Suggest cutting edge industry patterns, features and scenarios for given domain
5. For every NEW scenario or step put mandatory [NEW] prefix!

KEEP ORIG_BEHAVIOUR STRUCTURE, CREATE NEW SCENARIOS IN THE END, CREATE NEW STEPS INLINE, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DIFF later,
